  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <div> 
    <p> Femi Anikulapo Kuti was born in London to Fela and Remilekun (Remi) Ransome-Kuti (née Taylor; 1961–1985), and grew up in the former Nigerian capital, Lagos. His mother soon left his father, taking Femi to live with her. In 1977, however, Femi chose to move in with his father. Femi started playing the saxophone at the age of 15 and eventually became a member of his father's band.[1] He studied at Baptist Academy and Igbobi College.</p>

    <p>[2]Like his father, Femi has made commitments to social and political causes throughout his career.[3] Femi's grandmother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a political campaigner and women's rights activist.[4] Though Femi is the son of an international icon, he considers his mother, Remilekun Taylor, to be his greatest influence.</p>
      
    <p>[5]He created his own band, Positive Force, in the late 1980s with Dele Sosimi (Gbedu Resurrection), former keyboard player of Fela Anikulapo Kuti. His international career began in 1988 when he was invited by the French Cultural Centre in Lagos and Christian Mousset to perform at the Festival d'Angoulême (France), the New Morning Club in Paris and the Moers Festival in Germany.</p>
      
    <p>In 2001, Femi collaborated on his album Fight to Win with a number of US musicians, including Common, Mos Def, and Jaguar Wright.</p>
      
    <p>[6]Also in 2002, Femi contributed a remake of his father's classic song "Water No Get Enemy" to Red Hot & Riot, a compilation CD in tribute to Fela Kuti that was released by the Red Hot Organization and MCA. Femi's track was created in collaboration with hip-hop and R&B artists D'Angelo, Macy Gray, The Soultronics, Nile Rodgers and Roy Hargrove, and all proceeds from the CD were donated to charities dedicated to raising AIDS awareness or fighting the disease.</p>
      
    <p>Femi Kuti's voice is featured in the videogame Grand Theft Auto IV, where he is the host of radio station IF 99 (International Funk 99, described as "playing a great selection of classics from West Africa, the US and elsewhere").</p>
